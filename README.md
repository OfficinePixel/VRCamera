# VR Mobile Camera

This node plugin for Gotot Engine  enable a new kind of 3D camera
It is needed if you wish to use a phone vr headset or cardboard.
It provide screen split for stereoscopic vision and head tracking
by using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor on the phone,
if gyroscope is not found, magnetometer will be used as fallback.
The plug in was tested on some Android devices
There is initial iOS support but it seems Godot can't access magnometer
and gyroscope data on such OS.
